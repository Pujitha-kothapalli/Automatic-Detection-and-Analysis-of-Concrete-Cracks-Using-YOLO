<h3>Description</h3>
This repository presents an innovative approach for the automated detection and analysis of concrete cracks utilizing deep learning techniques, particularly the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. Concrete structures are susceptible to various forms of deterioration, with cracks serving as early indicators of potential structural issues. Traditional methods for crack detection and analysis are often time-consuming and subjective. In this research, we leverage deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to automatically detect and categorize cracks in concrete surfaces.

<br>
The proposed model is trained on a diverse dataset of concrete images, enabling it to generalize across different environmental conditions and crack patterns. Additionally, the research extends beyond crack detection to predict the potential lifespan of concrete structures, contributing to proactive maintenance planning and resource allocation for long-term sustainability.
